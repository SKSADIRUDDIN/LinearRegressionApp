# Simple Linear Regression App for Predicting House Prices

This is a Streamlit-based web application that uses a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the size of the house. The application is built using Python and leverages popular libraries such as `Streamlit`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Plotly`, and `Scikit-learn`.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a simple machine learning model and deploy it as a web application using Streamlit. The application predicts house prices based on the size of the house using a linear regression model. The data is generated synthetically, and the model is trained on this data.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: The app provides an interactive interface where users can input the size of the house and get a predicted price.
- **Data Visualization**: The app visualizes the relationship between house size and price using a scatter plot. The predicted price is highlighted on the plot.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: The app uses a simple linear regression model to make predictions.
